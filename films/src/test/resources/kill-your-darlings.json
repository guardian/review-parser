This movie by John Krokidas is superior to both, with Daniel Radcliffe giving an intelligent and considered performance as the young Allen Ginsberg.</p> <p>There is admittedly some of the same self-consciousness and 50s beat preciousness with polo-necked guys nodding life-affirmingly to live jazz. But it&apos;s also revealing about the role played by violence, shame and denial at the birth of beat and of Ginsberg&apos;s career. These ignited the poetry, and the film suggests that the poetic impulse is at least initially a flight impulse; an impulse away from a horrible real-world mess to a vantage point from where the mess can be artistically controlled, absorbed, acknowledged and accounted for. The story is about Ginsberg&apos;s relationship with Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) when they were students at Columbia: Carr was the troubled young aesthete to whom Ginsberg was to dedicate the first edition of Howl, and who was to be involved in a grisly act of violence. Radcliffe gives a forthright and candid performance as Ginsberg, very plausibly representing his idealism and sexual naivety. He is evolving into a formidable and potent screen presence.</p>",
