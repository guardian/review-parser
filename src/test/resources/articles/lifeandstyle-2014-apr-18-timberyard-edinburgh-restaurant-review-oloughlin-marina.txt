<p>Let&apos;s have a gander at the menu: sea buckthorn and thyme soda, Douglas fir and treacle, plum shrub soda, burnt lemonade. And that&apos;s just the soft drinks list. Little wonder <a href="http://www.timberyard.co/index.php" title="">Timberyard</a>&apos;s arrival was <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/goingout/food-review" title="">welcomed with words such as &quot;game-changing&quot; and &quot;paradigm-shifting&quot;</a>.</p> <p>Edinburgh is temperamentally closer to Copenhagen than, say, Bristol, so it&apos;s unsurprising to find a chef whose plates owe more to the likes of <a href="http://www.kadeau.dk/kbh_english.php" title="">Kadeau</a>, <a href="http://www.restaurant-relae.dk/en/" title="">Relae</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/rene-redzepi" title="">Noma</a> than to home-grown hotshots. It&apos;s so uncompromising, so stripped back, you half expect to witness a spot of light butchery in the interior courtyard. They&apos;re doing the whole local produce thang, of course, but aim to take it further into a degree of self-sufficiency and zero waste. And dour Edinburgh, instead of clutching well-bred pearls to crepy throat at this terrifying modernity, has embraced it with an enthusiasm that&apos;s bordering on the unseemly.</p> <p>Perhaps that&apos;s because the place has heritage: it&apos;s the baby of a local restaurant dynasty, the Radfords, ex of Atrium and Blue. Here, they&apos;ve installed chef son Ben with other offspring manning the front of house. And a gorgeous house it is, too, a looming, high-ceilinged former warehouse (timber yard, obviously), hard surfaces softened with tartan blankets and wood-burning stove, old-school – literally – blackboards talking of bewitching tinctures.</p> <p>There&apos;s a lot to love. From the handsome beardy (natch) staff, to an alluring wine list (we&apos;re wowed by a <a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/casal+de+arman+ribeiro/2011/uk" title="">2011 ribeiro</a> from Casal de Arman and a luscious <a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/collefrisio+falanghina/2012/uk" title="">Collefrisio falanghina</a>), to a menu than marries Nordic pickling, foraging, smoking and curing with classic French technique and a refreshing fondness for fine Scottish dairy products. Yay! Cream!</p> <p>The menu is sectioned into Bite, Small, Large, Sweet; we&apos;re encouraged to have something from each. A party of three could easily scoff the whole lot. &quot;Bite&quot; translates into little more than an amuse, but at £4.50 for the privilege. Though privilege is the right word in the case of a single, pristine langoustine highlighted by blades of acidulated fennel, tarragon and cream, the aniseedy elements leaving only the ghost of an impression, the crustacean&apos;s butter-infused flesh yielding and sweet. Another Bite – raw, velvety scallops bobbing in various intense green pools created by watercress and cucumber, blobbed with creme fraiche and confetti&apos;d with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlearia" title="">scurvy grass</a> – looks like a culinary lava lamp.</p> <p>There&apos;s some serious fun and games, too: a hay-smoked duck egg, a play on the Chinese 1,000-year job, its bronze-burnished white giving way to a yolk that pools out like golden, smoky magma; tradition is ticked by alluringly charred asparagus, modernity by a patio of toasted rye breadcrumbs. Most Noma-esque of all is a hunk of magnificent Scottish beef (not sous-vided – hooray!) that tastes almost brined, with foetal carrots, petals of just-charred onions and a pungent slick of kale; the jus is so intense, it&apos;s as if they&apos;ve wrung out a cow.</p> <p>But I&apos;d like Radford Jr to chill out a bit, to stop strewing plates with what sometimes looks like the top layer of my composter. It&apos;s disconcerting to encounter unidentifiable furry leaves, like de-fanged nettles, that do little other than startle the tongue, and not in a good way. Smoked sea trout comes with squid so tough, it&apos;s like chewing a petrified condom, plus on the same plate crunchy barrels of beetroot and salsify, dill, yoghurt, primrose, jewels of salmon roe and maggot-like knotroot that&apos;s almost tooth-bouncingly raw.</p> <p>I&apos;m totally up for innovation, but when Nordic tendencies start heading towards the hair-shirted, I start jonesing for a nice rarebit and glass of port. (There&apos;s <a href="http://www.gq.com/life/food/201403/alan-richman-dude-food" title="">an excellent piece by Alan Richman</a> about the cult of &quot;egotarian cuisine&quot; that&apos;s more about chef than diner. The food here can teeter in that direction.)</p> <p>But otherwise, yes, Timberyard can own &quot;game-changing&quot;. Excitement often comes with an edge, and is all the more exciting for it. This is the biggest thrill I&apos;ve had in Edinburgh since a pop star&apos;s mum flashed at me from a Stockbridge basement.</p> <p>• <a href="http://www.timberyard.co" title=""><strong>Timberyard</strong></a> 10 Lady Lawson Street, Edinburgh, 0131-221 1222.
