<p><a href="http://www.rexra.com/about-us" title="">Messrs Corbin and King</a>, the chaps behind such smashes as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/feb/21/foodanddrink.shopping1" title="">The Wolseley</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/13/the-delaunay-london-wc2-review" title="">The Delaunay</a>, are not exactly known for their common touch. If you&apos;re, say, <a href="http://www.christopherbiggins.com/" title="">Christopher Biggins</a>, you&apos;ll glide straight into their restaurants&apos; hallowed inner circles, but if you&apos;re hoi polloi, you&apos;ll be consigned to the chilly, billy no-mates periphery. I&apos;ve been told off in the past <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/lifestyle/restaurants/886293-the-delaunay-starchy-societys-new-canteen" title="">for caring about this sort of thing</a> – I am, apparently, a shallow cow who should pay more attention to my companions than the fact I&apos;m facing the lavs – but in restaurants such as these, seeing and being seen is kind of the point.</p> <p>So, in the spirit of sheer badness, I turn up at their latest, <a href="http://www.brasseriezedel.com/brasserie-zedel" title="">Brasserie Zédel</a>, a wildly expensive reimagining of the former Regent Palace Hotel Grill Room (latterly <a href="http://www.peytonandbyrne.co.uk/profile/index.html" title="">Oliver Peyton</a>&apos;s Atlantic Bar &amp; Grill) without a booking. Wearing Topshop. And with a pair of children. Probably the trade&apos;s worst table configuration, after a Bacardi Breezer&apos;d-up hen party. Well, sucks to me: despite the place heaving, we&apos;re wafted straight to a booth at the glittering bar – it&apos;s like the one in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76626/shining" title="">The Shining</a> – and then to a table in the middle of the vast room. I&apos;m thrown into confusion: is the middle of the room the new periphery? Total advantage Corbin &amp; King.</p> <p>More confusion: the prices. They&apos;re having a laugh, surely? How can a gaff that breathes the contented sigh of so much loot – look at all that marble! The real gold-leaved architraves! The liveried crockery and peachy linen! – feature a menu where one starter is £2.25 and main courses average a tenner? A fine lemon tart – short, crisp pastry, dense, lemony custard – is three quid. It&apos;s as dizzying as the thought that this whole Beaux Arts-style brasserie was taken apart and reassembled like a vast, architectural jigsaw.</p> <p>Otherwise, the food is by and large defiantly ordinaire. As it is at the likes of Paris&apos;s redoubtable <a href="http://www.restaurant-chartier.com/www/visit/filsdesans.php" title="">Chartier</a>, to which the owners acknowledge a debt and several similarities of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/alloallo/" title="">&apos;Allo &apos;Allo</a>-ish menu item: carottes rapées, oeufs durs mayonnaise, choucroute Alsacienne… Apart from excellent bread and butter, it all tastes a little, well, cheap. The most expensive starter is a foie gras parfait, but the mousse is granular, as if the buttery foie were cut with a cheaper ingredient such as, maybe, chicken liver; its crystalline cubes of jelly are watery, not solid, sticky sauternes. Pissaladière (£3) brings a large square of well-fired pastry heavy with caramelised onions and anchovies (the correct, salted jobs). This with a £2.50 salad would make a fine lunch.</p> <p>Cheap steak cuts – onglet/hanger, bavette/flank – are big news right now, repackaged as the cognoscenti&apos;s choice: whack of flavour, has to be rare, none of yer girlie fillet. Zédel&apos;s onglet is butch to the point of overpowering, ropey-textured with a sweet, almost horse-meaty quality. Boeuf bourguignon – OK, it&apos;s less than a tenner and comes with decent mash, but oh dear: dry, overstewed meat, a couple of teeny onions and, weirdly, carrots in various stages of cookedness from mushy to near-raw. The dish I like best is a simple céleri rémoulade: spaghetti strands of the root dressed in a luxurious, mustardy mayo, plonked on the plate with no adornment, simple and satisfying.</p> <p>Am I being petty? It&apos;s not as if anyone chooses The Wolseley or The Delaunay primarily for the food. Because of Zédel&apos;s recherché menu, a few pundits have mentioned the dreaded <a href="http://www.caferouge.co.uk/" title="">Cafe Rouge</a> in the same breath. I call by the Kingsway branch and – get this – it&apos;s more expensive; and an experience I&apos;d rather trepan my own head than ever repeat.</p> <p>Is Zédel the ultimate democratic move from two master manipulators, or just a pile &apos;em high, sell &apos;em cheap exercise dictated by the financial logistics of the extraordinary setting? Like <a href="http://www.bofingerparis.com/en/" title="">Bofinger</a> and <a href="http://www.espritbrasserie.com/page/brasserie" title="">Flo</a> in Paris, it may be destined for colonisation by tourists. As you sweep down the staircase, it has the effect of making you feel like a tourist in your own city. But it also feels like an event, a big night out, even on a wet Monday with two kids in tow. And at under £30 a head, complete with pichets of picpoul, that&apos;s quite an achievement.</p> <p>• <a href="http://www.brasseriezedel.com" title=""><strong>Brasserie Zédel</strong></a>, 20 Sherwood Street, W1, 020 7734 4888, Open all week, noon-midnight. About £30 a head.</p> <p>Follow Marina on <a href="http://twitter.com/MarinaOLoughlin" title="">Twitter</a></p> <p>• This article was edited on 3 September 2012.
